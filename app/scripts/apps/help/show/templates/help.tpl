<p>Really? Do you really need help? Are you trying to tell me that the UI of the app is not good enough? Haha, kidding. Let’s try to explain the basic controls and how would I use multikanban.</p>

<h2>Basic controls</h2>
<h3>Menu</h3>

<p>In the left menu, you can control everything about the kanban boards. To create them you just press the “+”, write the kanban title and press “+” or “enter”.</p>

<p>The active kanban is the one with the white background.</p>

<p>You can edit any kanban title or just delete it (careful! You will lose all the tasks of the kanban!) by hovering over the kanban in the menu and clicking on the pencil (to edit) or the “x” (to delete).</p>

<p>You can reprioritize kanbans by dragging them up and down.</p>

<h3>Kanban</h3>

<p>You can edit the kanban title by clicking on the pencil when hovering the title.
Each kanban has 6 columns. Columns can be sorted by Custom sort (the priorization set by the user)  using the list icon, date of creation ascending and descending, and date of completion ascending and descending using the arrows icon. The two last columns don’t have custom sort and are displayed by date of completion descending by default. The current sort type is shown by displaying the icons in green.</p>

<p>Each column header shows the number of tasks the column contains.</p>

<p>To add tasks, you have to click on the “+” in the Backlog column, define a title and click “+” or press “enter”.</p>

<p>Each task has a date of creation, a date of completion (when it applies) and a text that defines the task itself. You can edit the task by clicking on the pencil when hovering the task, or delete it by clicking the “X”. Deleting always requires confirmation.</p> 

<p>Tasks can be dragged around the columns and into a different position in the same column. Note that if the task is dragged to a column with an specific sort order, the task will immediately be shown in the right position which might fall out of your viewport.</p>


<h2>How to use multikanban</h2>

<p>So let’s just understand kanban as a to do list. A collection of tasks. At first, you’ll just have a kanban full of tasks like “learn photography”, “do my personal blog” or “clean my room”. At some point though, you will see that some tasks are huge, and when you finally grow the courage to tackle them, you’ll want to divide them into several other tasks. It’s the time for “learn photography” to become a new kanban.</p>

<p>You create a new kanban called “Photography”, and start creating all the tasks related to photography you can come up with, from simple ideas to obvious things. All these ideas and tasks are created in the “Backlog”, which is basically a pool of tasks, many of which you will do and many of which you will never do. “Read about what camera to buy”, “Ask Jake about what camera should I buy”, “Buy a camera”, “get a flickr account”, “read about landscape photography”, “timelapse of Barcelona”, “underwater photography”, and a long etcetera.</p>

<p>When the backlog already has some of the tasks I want to do and I feel I have divided them enough I then use it as follows:</p>
<p>-	At the beginning of every week I move the tasks I feel I will be able to do to the “To Do” column. With time you will learn to estimate better the amount of work you can get done (considering we have a life :D) but the idea is to define the most prioritary tasks out of random ideas that make no sense yet. I normally prioritize the tasks in the “To Do” column too. The first task is the one is should get rid of first and so on.</p>
<p>-	Every day, move to “Doing” what you feel you can accomplish during that day. If you feel very productive, you can also just grab tasks one by one, the idea is basically that it gets obvious what you are doing and what you are not doing. We suck at doing more than one thing at the same time, so let’s just do what we are good at, tasks one by one.</p>
<p>-	When you are done, just move them to the “Done” column. By the end of the week you’ll see what you’ve accomplished, and trust me, feels good.</p>
<p>-	The week is over and you feel good, well, time to move all the tasks from “Done” to “Archive” and depending on what is left in “To Do” (empty? Good job!) decide what to take from the Backlog to tackle next.</p>
<p>-	In “Archive” you’ll always be able to track all the work you’ve done since the project started.</p>
<p>-	You may have seen there is an “On Hold” column too. It is for those tasks that you are doing but you can’t proceed for whoever reason, you are waiting for someone else to send you some info, you need to go pick something on a specific date, etcetera… It’s to take noise out of what you are actually “Doing”.</p>

<p>In every column tasks can be sorted by date. This is pretty cool to learn which tasks have been wandering over for too long, its not always about what we feel like doing but also about what we must do.</p> 

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>Calling them principles sounds pedant but these are some small pieces of knowledge that can really get you through when you understand their true meaning.</p>

<p>-	<b>Visualize the workflow:</b>
The main idea of kanban is that you visualize the tasks you have to do and at which stage they are. It is not just a boring list but some notes that you drag around. The simple action of moving them to the right is motivating enough to get you going. You can see everything you have done in the blink of an eye and just keep going.</p>

<p>-	<b>Limit work in progress:</b> 
This is another of the main concepts behind kanban. We are not good at doing many things at a time, so limiting the work we are doing at every moment is very important. Step by step, drop by drop.</p>

<p>-	<b>Divide and conquer:</b> 
I think this is the most important. The more you divide your tasks the easier you’ll get them done. You will also feel like you have done more, and besides feeling good, you will have actually done more. Big tasks aren’t that intimidating once they are broken down.</p>

<p>-	<b>Prioritize:</b>
Really, you can’t do everything. At least I can’t, it is so easy to come up with ideas but heh, doing them is quite different. Prioritize the tasks you have to do is as important as knowing what you have to give up to. Learn to discard.</p>

<p>-	<b>Do a little bit everyday:</b> 
This sounds dumb but it is key. Even in those days where you don’t have time nor will, just do something, the simplest of the tasks, but do it to keep the flow, the momentum going. Motivation is temporary.</p>

<p>-	<b>Think about what's next:</b>
Or rephrased, think about what you are doing tomorrow. Going to sleep every night thinking about what you will be doing the next day is great to start thinking and motivating yourself about it.</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>There are many ways to use multikanban. Here, I explain the initially created examples that show different uses:</p>
<p>-	<b>To do list:</b> You can use kanban as a general to do list. The tasks don’t even need to have much to do with each other, it is just what you need to get done. Instead of marking them as done you just drag them to the done column, you can even use it as an agenda for events that are to happen long in the future.</p>
<p>-	<b>A project:</b> Something like the explained above “learn photography” or “create personal blog” are projects that involve several tasks, creating a kanban for each project is a very good way to categorize the tasks and to see the project you are doing in each project. Even prioritizing kanbans in the menu is a good way to go.</p>
<p>-	<b>Books:</b> So you read a lot. Well, you can simply add all the books you want to read and track them. Some books will be just friends recommendations (Backlog), others will be awaiting in your shelf (To Do), one or two will be half way through in the night table, and others will be blurring away in your head (Done/Archive).</p>
